Introduction  
 
The IV Characteristics of a diode can be expressed by an equation known as the Schockley diode equation: 
  
The name of a diode must start with D, and it takes the general form  
D<name> NA NK DNAME[(area) value] 
where NA and NK are the node the cathode nodes, respectively. The current flows from anode node NA through the diode to cathode node NK. DNAME is the model name. 
Some diode statements are 
D15 33 35 SWITCH 1.5 
.MODEL SWITCH D(IS=100E–15 CJO=2PF TT=12NS BV=100 IBV=10E–3) 
DCLAMP 0 8 DIN914 
.MODEL DIN914 D (IS=100E–15 CJO=2PF TT=12NS BV=100 IBV=10E–3) 
The EVAL library of the PSpice student version supports few low power diodes such as D1N4002, D1N4148, and D1N914.  
  
ID = current through the diode, A 
VD = diode voltage with anode positive with respect to cathode, V 
Is = leakage (or reverse saturation) current, typically in the range 10–6 to 10–20 A n = Empirical constant known as the emission coefficient (or ideality factor),
whose value varies from 1 to 2 The emission coefficient, n, depends on the material and the physical construction of diodes. For germanium diodes, n is considered 
to be 1. For silicon diodes, the predicted value of n is 2, but for most silicon diodes the value of n is in the range 1.1 to 1.8. 
VT in Equation is a constant called the thermal voltage, and it is given by:

The parameters that are required to model a diode in PSpice are as under: 
  
However to keep the modeling simple following statement will give close enough approximation as a diode.

Diode Rectifiers 
A rectifier converts an AC voltage to a DC voltage and uses diodes as the switching devices. The output voltage of an ideal rectifier should be pure DC and contain
no harmonics or ripples. Similarly, the input current should be pure sine wave and contain no harmonics. That is, the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the input 
current and output voltage should be zero, and the input power factor should be unity.The output voltage, the output current, and the input current of a rectifier 
contain harmonics. The input power factor PFi can be determined from the THDi of the input current as follows: 
 
  where 
I1(rms) = rms value of the fundamental input current Is = rms value of the input current 
φ1 = angle between the fundamental component of the input current and the fundamental component of the input voltage %THD = percentage total harmonic distortion 
of the input current 
1. Finding the Performance of a Half Wave Diode Rectifier 
A single-phase half-wave rectifier is shown in Figure. The input voltage is sinusoidal with a peak of 169.7 V, 60 Hz. The load inductance L is 6.5 mH, and the load 
resistance R is 0.5Ω. Use PSpice (a) to plot the instantaneous output voltage vo and the load current io, (b) to calculate the Fourier coefficient of the output 
voltage, and (c) to find the input power factor. Please use simple diode model and modify PSpice model of D1N4002 as under:

Output:

 

 
 

DC input current Iin(DC) =  43.246
Rms fundamental input current, I1(rms) =  38.26
THD of input current THD =   0.16154
Harmonic input current, Ih(rms) = I1(rms) ∗ THD = 38.26*0.16154 = 6.1807
Rms input current,   Is = [I2in(dc) + I21(rms) + I2h(rms)]0.5=   2.786
Displacement angle φ1 = 66.13
Displacement factor DF = cosφ1= 0.4046
Thus, the input power factor is given [1] by: 
     = 0.3994
 
The power factor can also be determined directly from the THD as follows: 
   
This gives a higher value and cannot be applied if there is a significant amount of DC component.  
Note: The load current is discontinuous. When the diode turns off, there is a voltage transient. If an antiparallel diode (also known as the freewheeling diode) is 
connected across the load, the load current will be smoother. As a result, the power factor will improve. Students are encouraged to simulate the circuit with an 
antiparallel diode to verify this. 
2. Finding the Performance of a Single­Bridge Rectifier 
A single-phase bridge rectifier is shown in Figure. The sinusoidal input voltage has a peak of 170 V, 60 Hz. The load inductance L is 6.5mH, and the load resistance 
R is 0.5Ω. Use PSpice (a) to plot the instantaneous output voltage vo and the load current io and (b) to calculate the Fourier coefficients of the input current and 
the input power factor.

Conclusion: 
We looked into single phase half wave rectifier. In this first part, as the inductor was also included with the resistor as the load, therefore it becomes the energy 
source when the negative cycle of applied voltage is at the anode of diode. In the second part, we looked into the bridge configuration. The output voltage is 
rectified in both cases. For each of the positive and negative voltage cycle, two of the four diodes are closed and therefore current flows through the circuit.
The polarity of the current remains same for both cycles.
